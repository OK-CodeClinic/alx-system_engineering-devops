In this project i learned how to build regular expression using Oniguruma Library that uses Ruby by default. 

## Technologies
- Scripts written in Bash
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS


## Author

- [Kehinde Omokungbe](https://www.github.com/OK-CodeClinic)
## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env ruby
- All your regex must be built for the Oniguruma library

  * [1-repetition_token_0.rb](./1-repetition_token_0.rb): Ruby script that matches
  the regular expression `hbn` with between 2-5 `t`'s in between `hb` and `n`.

* **2. Repetition Token #1**
  * [2-repetition_token_1.rb](./2-repetition_token_1.rb): Ruby script that matches
  the regular expression `hn` with 0 or 1 occurrences of `b` and 0 or 1
  occurrences of `t` in between `h` and `n`.

* **3. Repetition Token #2**
  * [3-repetition_token_2.rb](./3-repetition_token_2.rb): Ruby script that matches
  the regular expression `hbn` with 1 or more `t`'s in between `hb` and `n`.

* **4. Repetition Token #3**
  * [4-repetition_token_3.rb](./4-repetition_token_3.rb): Ruby script that matches the
  regular expression `hbn` with 0 or more `t`'s in between `hb` and `n`.

* **5. Not quite HBTN yet**

  regular expression starting with `h` and ending with `n` with any single character in between.

* **6. Call me maybe**
  * [6-phone_number.rb](./6-phone_number.rb): Ruby script that matches a regular expression
  representing a 10-digit phone number.

* **7. OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?**
