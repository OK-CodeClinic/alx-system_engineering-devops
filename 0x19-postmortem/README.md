# Postmortem:  Apache Error 500 Incident

### Description:
This covers the article of how i debugged the project task in Web stack debugging of Apache showing error-500, with a flowchart and how it was achieved.


## FLOWCHART
## ANALYSIS


### ISSUE SUMMARY:

 #### Duration: 
 September 15, 2023, 10:00 AM  11:30 AM UTC
 #### Impact: 
 Extended downtime of our web application, resulting in an Apache Error 500 for 20% of users.
 #### Root Cause:
  Configuration issue in the Apache web server.

### TIMELINE:

 #### 10:00 AM UTC: 
 The incident began when users reported encountering an Apache Error 500 when accessing our web application.

 #### 10:15 AM UTC: 
 Our monitoring system flagged a surge in HTTP 500 errors. Engineers initiated investigations into the issue.

 #### 10:30 AM UTC: 
 Initial assumptions led the team to believe it might be a server resource exhaustion problem. Investigation began on the server side components.

#### 10:45 AM UTC: 
Server resources were deemed sufficient. The incident was escalated to the DevOps team.
 #### 11:00 AM UTC:
  Team examined server configurations and detected a misconfiguration in the Apache web server settings.
 #### 11:15 AM UTC: 
 The misconfigured Apache settings were isolated and corrected.
 #### 11:30 AM UTC: 
 The issue was resolved, and the web application returned to normal operation.

### ROOT CAUSE AND RESOLUTION:

 #### Root Cause: 
 The root cause of the Apache Error 500 incident was a misconfiguration in the Apache web server settings. Specifically, a critical parameter related to request handling was improperly set.

 #### Resolution: 
 The DevOps team identified the misconfiguration and corrected it in the Apache configuration files. This adjustment restored the proper request handling, resolving the issue and eliminating the Apache Error 500 responses.





### CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTATIVE MEASURES: 

#### To Improve i fixed: 

1. Configuration Review: Implement a rigorous review process for server configuration changes to prevent misconfigurations.

2. Automated Health Checks: Enhance automated monitoring to proactively detect and alert on critical server configuration changes or issues.

3. Documentation Updates: Maintain comprehensive documentation on server configurations and update it promptly whenever changes are made.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

1. Configuration Audit: Conduct an audit of all server configurations to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.

2. Automated Monitoring Enhancements: Implement automated checks for critical configuration parameters and integrate them into the monitoring system.

3. Using strace, find out why Apache is returning a 500 error. Once you find the issue, fix it and then automate it using Puppet (instead of using Bash as I previously did).

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to fortify our web application's reliability and performance, reducing the likelihood of encountering Apache Error 500 issues in the future. This proactive approach will help maintain a seamless user experience and minimize the impact of similar incidents.
